### Installing the Operating Systems and Initial Setup

I initiated the installations by attaching the ISO files to their respective VMs. Windows Server 2019 required additional attention during setup to ensure proper administrative access. Here are the specifics:

- **Install Windows Server 2019:** Follow the on-screen instructions until you reach the account setup stage.

### Laying Down the Operating Systems and Configuring NICs

I initiated the installation process after attaching the ISO files to their respective VMs. The on-screen instructions are generally straightforward, leading to a successful installation of both operating systems.

In addition, for our Domain Controller, it's imperative to configure dual Network Interface Cards (NICs) for effective network management. Here's how I set them up

- **NIC for Open Internet:** The first NIC is configured to use Network Address Translation (NAT), enabling our Domain Controller to connect to the open Internet.
  
- **NIC for Internal Network:** The second NIC is allocated exclusively to our internal virtual network, ensuring isolated communication within our simulated environment.

This dual NIC setup equips the Domain Controller with the network versatility needed for real-world applications, aligning perfectly with our lab's objectives. 

Doing so has established a secure yet flexible network topology indispensable for our Active Directory Lab.




## Integrating Active Directory Domain Services

- Upon booting up Windows Server, I ventured into the Server Manager, and from there, I meticulously added the "Active Directory Domain Services" role.

<img width="1234" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2630402-2273-4ce0-94a1-8e4209989390" />



## Creating a Domain Admin Account

- Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
- Right-click and select New > User.
- Provide details for your new Domain Admin account and set a strong password.

## Set Up DHCP Server

- In Server Manager, I added the "DHCP Server" role to enable our client machine to automatically receive an IP address through dynamic allocation.
- 
## Structuring the Organizational Unit

- Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
- Right-click on your domain, go to New > Organizational Unit, and create an OU.

## Configure Routing and Remote Access

- Go to Server Manager and add the "Routing" role.
- Configure Routing and Remote Access to set up an internal network.

## Configure NIC for Internet Access

- Open Network and Sharing Center and go to "Change adapter settings."
- Configure the NIC to connect to the outside internet.

## Add Users via PowerShell

In a typical organizational environment, it's common to manage hundreds or even thousands of users. Manually creating each account would be highly inefficient. To streamline this process, I utilized a PowerShell script for bulk user creation. Let‚Äôs break down the BulkAddUserScript.ps1 script to understand how it works and what it does.

### Define Variables:

    # ----- Edit these Variables for your own Use Case ----- #
    $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS   = "Password1"
    $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-Content .\names.txt
    # ------------------------------------------------------ #

Here, two variables are being defined:

- ```$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS = "Password1":``` This variable defines a default password‚Äîset to "Password1"‚Äîfor every user account. While using a shared password isn‚Äôt ideal in production environments due to security concerns, it‚Äôs acceptable for this controlled lab setting.
- ```$USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-Content .\names.txt:``` This command reads from the file names.txt, which contains a list of names formatted as "FirstName LastName", one per line. These names are used to generate user accounts automatically.
  
### Convert Plain Text Password:

      $password = ConvertTo-SecureString $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS -AsPlainText -Force

- PowerShell user management commands typically require passwords to be in a secure string format for security purposes. In this step, the plain text password stored in the ```$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS``` variable is converted into a secure string and saved in the $password variable.
  
### Create Organizational Unit (OU):

    New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name _USERS -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false

- In this step, an Organizational Unit (OU) named `_USERS` is created. The `-ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false` parameter means the OU can be accidentally deleted, which is acceptable for a lab setting. However, in a production environment, it's recommended to enable protection.


### Loop Through Names and Create Users:

    foreach ($n in $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST) {
    ...
    }

- Each name in the ($USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST) is processed through the following set of actions.
  
### Extract the first and last names:

    $first = $n.Split(" ")[0].ToLower()
    $last = $n.Split(" ")[1].ToLower()

- The `.Split(" ")` method divides the full name into first and last names using the space as a separator. After that, the `.ToLower()` method converts both names to lowercase.


### Construct the username:
    
    $username = "$($first.Substring(0,1))$($last)".ToLower()
- This line builds the username by combining the first letter of the first name with the entire last name, all in lowercase. For instance, if the name is `"John Doe"`, the resulting username would be `"jdoe"`.


### Display progress in the console:

    Write-Host "Creating user: $($username)" -BackgroundColor Black -ForegroundColor Cyan
    
- This line outputs a message to the console indicating the user that is being created.

### Create the new user:


    New-AdUser ...

- The `New-AdUser` cmdlet is used to create a new user in Active Directory. The script sets several parameters like given name, surname, display name, and more, placing the user in the `_USERS OU` created earlier. The `-PasswordNeverExpires $true` parameter prevents the user's password from expiring, which is acceptable for a lab setup, but in a live production environment, you typically want to enforce password expiration.


### Why are we doing this?

This script is primarily designed to highlight the automation potential in managing Active Directory, particularly when handling numerous user accounts. Instead of manually adding each user‚Äîa process that can be slow and prone to mistakes‚Äîthis script automates the workflow, improving accuracy and saving time. It demonstrates how PowerShell can effectively simplify administration tasks within Windows environments, providing a practical example of its usefulness in everyday IT operations.


### Client Interaction and User Experience

After setting up our Windows 10 VM, I configured it to connect to the server environment. Then, I logged out and logged back in to simulate the experience of a user created in the batch process.
